# Asymmetric Lattice Formation in Quadcopter SwarmsThis project implements lattice flocking for a swarm of quadcopter with asymmetric lattice parameters and visibility constraints.# MethodologyThis work expands on the lattice formation work of Olfati-Saber (2006) by loosening the assumption that all agents share common lattice parameters. We develop a novel consensus-based approach for agents to negotiate these parameters locally.In addition to having a minimum visibility radius for detecting nearby neighbours (as in previous work), we further constrain the agent visibility to a field of view parameter (representing the area captured by an onboard camera). We formulate the swarm as a set of directional graph components that automatically assembly using pinning control. Pins are selected to maximize out-degree centrality. The swarming techniques above are all implemented as high-level trajectory planners, assuming underlying double integrator dynamics. This resultant command signals, which take the form of accelerations in Cartesian space, are then converted into velocity setpoints for the quadcopters.The quadcopters make use of 3 nested control loops (translational velocity, angular position, and angular velocity) to track the desired trajectory.# DemonstrationsVideo of autonomous lattice formation using pinning control. Pins are shown in <span style="color:red"> red </span> and are recalculated for maximum out-degree centrality as the structure evolves.<p float="center">    <img src="./Figs_visible/animation3D_quad_10_dir_heter.gif" width="60%"></p># References 1.
